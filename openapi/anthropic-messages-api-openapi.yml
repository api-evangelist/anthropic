  title: Anthropic Prompt Tools API
  description: >
    The prompt tools APIs are in a closed research preview. These APIs are a set
    of tools to generate and improve prompts, similar to what's available in the
    Anthropic Workbench, and are intended for use by other prompt engineering
    platforms and playgrounds.


    **Note**: This is an experimental API that requires special access and
    doesn't have the same level of commitment to long-term support as other
    APIs.

                    The `task` parameter tells Claude what the prompt should do
                    or what kind of role or functionality you want to create.
                    This helps guide the prompt generation process toward your
                    intended use case.
                  example: a chef for a meal prep planning service
                target_model:

                      may include an assistant message with a prefill to guide
                      the model's initial response.

                      Directions similar to what would normally be included in a

                    Feedback for improving the prompt.

                    Use this parameter to share specific guidance on what
                    aspects of the prompt should be enhanced or modified.

                    When not set, the API will improve the prompt using general
                    prompt engineering best practices.
                  example: Make it more detailed and include cooking times
                system:
                  type: string
                  nullable: true
                  description: >
                    The existing system prompt to incorporate, if any.

                    Note that while system prompts typically appear as separate
                    parameters in standard API calls, in the improve_prompt
                    response, the system content will be incorporated directly
                    into the returned user message.
                  example: You are a professional chef
                target_model:
