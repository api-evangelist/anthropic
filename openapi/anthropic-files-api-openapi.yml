      description: >-
        The List Files operation is a GET request to the /files endpoint of the
        Anthropic Files API that retrieves a paginated list of all files that
        have been uploaded to your organization. This endpoint returns metadata
        about each file including the file ID, filename, size, content type,
        upload timestamp, and current status, allowing you to view and manage
        all files associated with your account without needing to download the
        actual file contents.

      summary: Create File
      description: >-
        The Create File operation in the Anthropic Files API allows you to
        upload files to Anthropic's servers by sending a POST request to the
        /files endpoint. This operation accepts multipart/form-data requests
        containing the file content along with metadata such as the file purpose
        and type. Upon successful upload, the API returns a file object with a
        unique identifier that can be referenced in subsequent API calls, such
        as when creating messages or working with other Anthropic services. The
        uploaded files are stored securely and can be retrieved, listed, or
        deleted using other endpoints in the Files API.

        The Delete File operation in the Anthropic Files API allows you to
        permanently remove a previously uploaded file from the system by
        specifying its unique file identifier in the endpoint path. When you
        send a DELETE request to /files/{file_id}, the API will locate and
        delete the corresponding file, freeing up storage space and ensuring the
        file is no longer accessible through the API. This operation is
        irreversible, so once a file is deleted, it cannot be recovered and any
        references to that file ID will no longer be valid. This endpoint is
        useful for managing your stored files, removing outdated or unnecessary
        content, and maintaining compliance with data retention policies.

        This endpoint returns the raw file data in its original format, allowing
