        The Get Organizations Me endpoint is a GET request available at
        `/organizations/me` in the Anthropic Admin API that retrieves
        information about the current authenticated user's organization. This
        endpoint allows administrators or users to fetch details about their own
        organization context without needing to specify an organization ID, as
        it automatically returns data for the organization associated with the
        authenticated request. It's particularly useful for applications that
        need to determine organizational settings, permissions, or metadata for
        the currently logged-in user's organization in a self-service manner.

        This API operation retrieves a list of users associated with a specific
        organization within the Anthropic platform. By sending a GET request to
        the /organizations/users endpoint, administrators can view all user
        accounts that have access to their organization, including details about
        each user's permissions, roles, and account status. This endpoint is
        typically used for user management tasks such as auditing organization
        membership, reviewing access levels, and maintaining oversight of who
        has access to the organization's resources and API capabilities.

        This API operation retrieves detailed information about a specific user
        within an organization by making a GET request to the endpoint
        /organizations/users/{user_id}, where {user_id} is the unique identifier

        user-specific data such as account details, permissions, roles, and
        other relevant attributes associated with that particular user in the
        Anthropic organization context. This endpoint is typically used for user
        management tasks, auditing purposes, or when you need to fetch the
        current state and properties of an individual user account within the
        organizational structure.

        Track token consumption across your organization with detailed
        breakdowns by model, 

        workspace, and service tier.


        **Key Concepts:**

        - Time buckets: Aggregate usage data in fixed intervals (1m, 1h, or 1d)

        - Token tracking: Measure uncached input, cached input, cache creation,
        and output tokens

        - Filtering & grouping: Filter by API key, workspace, model, service
        tier, or context window

        - Server tool usage: Track usage of server-side tools like web search


        **Time Granularity Limits:**

        - 1m: 60 buckets default, 1440 max (real-time monitoring)

        - 1h: 24 buckets default, 168 max (daily patterns)

        - 1d: 7 buckets default, 31 max (weekly/monthly reports)


        **Data Freshness:** Usage data typically appears within 5 minutes of API

      description: >
        Retrieve service-level cost breakdowns in USD.


        **Key Concepts:**

        - Currency: All costs in USD, reported as decimal strings in lowest
        units (cents)

        - Cost types: Track token usage, web search, and code execution costs

        - Grouping: Group costs by workspace or description for detailed
        breakdowns

        - Time buckets: Daily granularity only (1d)


        **Important:** Priority Tier costs use a different billing model and are
        not included 

        in the cost endpoint. Track Priority Tier usage through the usage
        endpoint instead.

      summary: Get  Organizations Usage Report Claude Code
      description: >
        Track Claude Code usage, productivity metrics, and developer activity
        across your organization.


        **Key Concepts:**

        - Daily aggregation: Returns metrics for a single day specified by the
        starting_at parameter

        - User-level data: Each record represents one user's activity for the
        specified day

        - Productivity metrics: Track sessions, lines of code, commits, pull
        requests, and tool usage

        - Token and cost data: Monitor usage and estimated costs broken down by
        Claude model

        - Cursor-based pagination: Handle large datasets with stable pagination
        using opaque cursors


        **Available Metrics:**

        - Core metrics: Sessions, lines of code (added/removed), commits, pull
        requests

        - Tool actions: Acceptance/rejection rates for Edit, Write, and
        NotebookEdit tools

        - Model breakdown: Token usage and estimated costs per Claude model


        **Data Freshness:** Metrics are available with up to 1-hour delay for
        consistency


        **Important Notes:**

        - Only tracks Claude Code usage on the Claude API (1st party)

        - Usage on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or other platforms is not
        included

        - API is free to use for all organizations with Admin API access

        - All dates are in UTC
