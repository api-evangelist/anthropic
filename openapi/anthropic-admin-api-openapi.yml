        The Get Organizations Me endpoint is a GET request available at
        `/organizations/me` in the Anthropic Admin API that retrieves
        information about the current authenticated user's organization. This
        endpoint allows administrators or users to fetch details about their own
        organization context without needing to specify an organization ID, as
        it automatically returns data for the organization associated with the
        authenticated request. It's particularly useful for applications that
        need to determine organizational settings, permissions, or metadata for
        the currently logged-in user's organization in a self-service manner.

        This API operation retrieves a list of users associated with a specific
        organization within the Anthropic platform. By sending a GET request to
        the /organizations/users endpoint, administrators can view all user
        accounts that have access to their organization, including details about
        each user's permissions, roles, and account status. This endpoint is
        typically used for user management tasks such as auditing organization
        membership, reviewing access levels, and maintaining oversight of who
        has access to the organization's resources and API capabilities.

      description: >-
        This API operation retrieves detailed information about a specific
        organization invite using its unique identifier. By making a GET request
        to the /organizations/invites/{invite_id} endpoint, administrators can
        access the current status and details of an invitation that was sent to
        a user to join an organization within the Anthropic platform. The
        {invite_id} path parameter uniquely identifies the invitation, and the
        response typically includes information such as the invitee's email
        address, invitation status (pending, accepted, or expired), the role or
        permissions associated with the invite, when it was created, and any
        relevant expiration details. This endpoint is useful for tracking and
        managing pending organization invitations, verifying invite details
        before resending, or auditing invitation history.

        This API endpoint allows administrators to delete a specific
        organization invite by providing the invite's unique identifier in the

        invitations that were sent in error, are no longer needed, or when
