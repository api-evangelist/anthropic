  title: Anthropic Message Batches API
  description: >-
    Send a batch of Message creation requests. The Message Batches API can be
    used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch
    is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24
    hours to complete.

      description: >-
        The List Message Batches operation is a GET request to the
        /messages/batches endpoint that retrieves a paginated list of all
        message batches associated with your account. This endpoint allows you
        to view and manage multiple batch processing jobs, returning details
        such as batch IDs, creation timestamps, processing status, and
        completion information for each batch. You can use optional query
        parameters to filter, sort, and paginate through your batches, making it
        easy to track and monitor asynchronous message processing operations at
        scale.

      summary: Create Message Batch
      description: >-
        The Create A Message Batch operation allows you to submit multiple
        message requests to be processed asynchronously as a batch through the
        Anthropic API. By sending a POST request to the /messages/batches
        endpoint, you can queue up numerous message generation tasks that will
        be processed in the background, making it ideal for high-volume,
        non-time-sensitive workloads. This batch processing approach is more
        cost-effective than individual real-time API calls and is particularly
        useful for tasks like large-scale data processing, content generation,
        or evaluation workflows where immediate responses aren't required. The
        API returns a batch identifier that you can use to track the status and
        retrieve results once processing is complete.

        The Anthropic Message Batches API endpoint for retrieving a message

        number of requests that have been processed versus the total submitted,

        The Delete A Message Batch operation allows you to permanently remove a

        request to /messages/batches/{message_batch_id}, where
        {message_batch_id} is the unique identifier of the batch you wish to
        delete. This operation is useful for cleaning up completed batches,
        removing batches that are no longer needed, or managing your storage and
        resource allocation. Once deleted, the message batch and its associated
        data cannot be recovered, so caution should be exercised when using this
        endpoint. The operation requires proper authentication and the user must
        have appropriate permissions to delete the specified batch. Upon
        successful deletion, the API typically returns a confirmation response
        indicating the batch has been removed from the system.

        Cancel a Message Batch that is currently being processed.


        Batches may be canceled any time before processing ends. Once
        cancellation is initiated,

        the batch enters a canceling state, at which time the system may
        complete any in-progress,

        non-interruptible requests before finalizing cancellation.


        The number of canceled requests is specified in request_counts. To
        determine which requests

        were canceled, check the individual results within the batch. Note that
        cancellation may not

        result in any canceled requests if they were non-interruptible.
